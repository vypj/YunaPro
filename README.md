# YunaPro Review 2026: Automate Facebook Marketing, Generate Leads Without Ads, Build Your Business Faster

Remember when growing a business on Facebook actually felt fun? Yeah, me neither. These days it's more like shouting into the void while watching your engagement drop like a rock. But here's something interesting—some people figured out how to turn Facebook into an actual lead-generating machine without burning through their ad budget.

That's where YunaPro comes into the picture. Created by Dave and Lucy Smith, two entrepreneurs who grew a Facebook group to over 30,000 members and pulled in more than $2 million in annual sales, this software tackles one of the biggest headaches for online coaches, consultants, and service providers: getting quality leads from Facebook without spending all day glued to your screen.

Let me walk you through what this thing actually does, what it costs, and whether it's worth your time in 2026.

**What Exactly Is YunaPro?**

YunaPro is a cloud-based automation platform designed specifically for Facebook marketing. Think of it as your tireless assistant who works around the clock finding leads, engaging with them, and moving them toward becoming paying clients—all while you're doing literally anything else.

The software uses a three-phase system that Dave and Lucy developed after years of trial and error building their own online coaching business. First, it finds your ideal prospects by scouring Facebook groups, monitoring content engagement, and even pulling leads from competitor ads. Second, it nurtures those leads through automated messages, comment replies, and strategic content tagging. Third, it tracks everything so you know exactly when someone's ready to buy.

What makes it different from just scheduling posts or using basic automation? YunaPro actually interacts with people on your behalf—liking comments, sending welcome messages, replying to posts—in a way that mimics natural human behavior. The founders were pretty adamant about this part: they wanted automation that felt authentic, not spammy.

**The Problem YunaPro Solves**

Let's talk about what's actually broken with Facebook marketing right now. You probably already know this from experience, but here it is anyway.

Most online business owners hit the same wall. They start with friends and family as their first clients. Those dry up fast. Then they're stuck posting content that barely gets seen, cold messaging people who ghost them, or throwing money at Facebook ads that may or may not work. Meanwhile, they're supposed to be delivering their actual service—the thing they're good at—but instead they're playing amateur marketer 40 hours a week.

Dave and Lucy call this the "Freedom Fallacy." You started an online business for flexibility and income, but now you're working more hours for less money than you did at your old job. The "Lead Letdown" is another one: after your initial network runs out, finding new qualified leads feels nearly impossible. And the "Squandered Skill"? That's when talented coaches and consultants give up entirely because they can't crack the marketing puzzle, even though they could genuinely help people.

YunaPro's pitch is simple: let the software handle the tedious Facebook stuff so you can focus on what you're actually good at.

**YunaPro Features: What You Get**

The platform includes 14 core automation tools. Here's what each one does:

**Group Leads** lets you extract potential clients from any Facebook group where your ideal customers hang out. You tell it what groups to monitor and what kinds of people to target, and it builds a list.

**Content Leads** identifies people based on what they're engaging with—posts, videos, articles. If someone's commenting on content related to your niche, YunaPro flags them as a potential lead.

**Ad Leads** is particularly clever. It scans your competitors' Facebook ads and grabs people who are engaging with them. These are folks already interested in what you offer; they just haven't found you yet.

**Welcome DMs** automatically sends personalized messages to new followers or group members. First impressions matter, and this ensures you're not leaving money on the table by ignoring new connections.

**Comment Likes** and **Comment Replies** handle engagement on your posts. The software can automatically like comments from your target audience and even reply with pre-written templates you create.

**Auto Messaging** is where things get interesting. You can set up entire conversation sequences that fire based on triggers—someone joins your group, clicks a link, watches a video. It's like having a 24/7 sales person in Messenger.

**Algorithm Boost** works by increasing engagement on your content, which signals to Facebook's algorithm that your stuff is worth showing to more people. More visibility equals more organic reach.

**Audience Growth** helps you gain targeted Facebook friends and followers by automating friend requests and follow actions based on your ideal customer profile.

**Group Growth** fills your Facebook group with qualified leads by inviting people who match your criteria.

**Email Growth** is a neat feature that captures email addresses directly from Facebook interactions, building your email list without making people jump through hoops.

**Instant Tagging** lets you tag people on relevant content to pull them back into your ecosystem and keep you top of mind.

**Lead Tracking** uses pipeline stages—welcome, nurture, offer—so you know exactly where each prospect is in your sales process and what to do next.

**Segmentation** divides your audience based on their actions and interests, so you can send the right message to the right person at the right time.

**Bulk Messaging** and **Templates** save you time by letting you send messages to multiple people at once using proven scripts that convert.

The software also includes Go HighLevel (a CRM and funnel builder) bundled in, which normally costs $194 per month on its own. That's where you'd build landing pages, take payments, manage your calendar, and handle email marketing—basically everything YunaPro doesn't do.

**YunaPro Pricing: What Does It Cost?**

Here's the money part. YunaPro offers two pricing options as of January 2026:

| Plan | Price | What You Pay | Annual Savings |
|------|-------|--------------|----------------|
|  [Monthly Plan](https://yunapro.com?_go=li34) | $197/month | $197 per month | N/A |
|  [Annual Plan](https://yunapro.com?_go=li34) | $141.42/month | $1,697 per year | Save $667 (28% off) |

Both plans include unlimited software access, lifetime strategy materials, weekly live coaching calls, and all eight bonus packages. The annual plan locks in your rate so it won't increase as long as you stay subscribed, and you never pay extra for updates or new features.

The bonuses are actually substantial. Along with Go HighLevel ($2,328 annual value), you get training programs on outsourcing your Facebook marketing, content creation patterns, Facebook group growth strategies, and scheduling systems. They also throw in VIP support, a private community, and workshop access.

Total package value? They claim $27,098, which is marketing math, but the core components alone would cost several thousand dollars if purchased separately.

**Important note:** YunaPro doesn't typically release public promo codes or discount coupons. The annual plan is their main discount offering. If you see third-party coupon sites claiming to have YunaPro codes, they're likely outdated or fake.

**Who Actually Uses This Thing?**

According to YunaPro's own numbers, members have generated over 900,000 targeted leads, brought in 15,000+ new clients, and collectively earned more than $32 million in online revenue. Those are big numbers. Let's look at who's using it.

The platform targets service-based online businesses: fitness coaches, business mentors, marketing consultants, copywriters, course creators, nutritionists, financial planners, marriage counselors, agency owners, dating coaches, and basically anyone selling expertise or services online.

Here's what some users say:

Jessica Holguin, an online marketing coach, mentioned making $5,000 in a week from a challenge launch without spending anything on Facebook ads. She specifically called out the quality of leads YunaPro delivered.

Angela Campbell, a fitness coach, reported signing seven new clients in seven days from leads that came through the system organically. She appreciated not having to chase "dead leads" anymore.

Amadeo Aram, a personal trainer, talked about having multiple sales calls daily and feeling confident that more qualified leads were consistently entering his funnel.

Jessica Marie, a personal finance coach, grew her Facebook group from 330 to 430 members in under a month without paying for ads—something that previously cost her over $1,000 to accomplish.

These are cherry-picked testimonials from the sales page, so take them with appropriate skepticism. But the pattern is consistent: people appreciate the time savings and lead quality more than anything else.

**The Safety Question Everyone Asks**

"Wait, isn't this against Facebook's rules?"

Fair question. Facebook has strict policies about automation, especially bots and inauthentic behavior. YunaPro's answer is that the software doesn't do anything you couldn't do manually—it just does it faster and more consistently.

The founders emphasize that YunaPro mimics natural human behavior rather than blasting spammy messages or gaming the system. They claim thousands of users haven't had account issues, though individual experiences may vary. Facebook's enforcement can be unpredictable.

YunaPro is a cloud-based platform that uses a Chrome extension to communicate with your browser. Your data is stored securely on their servers, not locally. It's not just another Chrome extension; it's more sophisticated infrastructure designed specifically to avoid detection and operate within Facebook's gray areas.

That said, any automation carries some risk. If you're building a business that depends entirely on Facebook access, you need to weigh that risk carefully.

**What You Don't Get**

YunaPro isn't magic. It won't write your content, create your offers, or build your entire business from scratch. You still need decent content to post, a clear service offering, and the ability to close sales once leads show interest.

The software also requires some upfront setup time. You need to configure your targeting criteria, write message templates, set up automation sequences, and learn how to use the various features. The weekly coaching calls help, but there's a learning curve.

And let's be honest: $197 per month isn't pocket change. For someone just starting out with zero revenue, that's a significant monthly expense. The annual plan saves money but requires even more upfront commitment.

**Is YunaPro Worth It in 2026?**

That depends on where you are in your business.

If you're an established coach, consultant, or service provider who's already making money but drowning in manual Facebook tasks, YunaPro could legitimately save you 10-20 hours per week while improving your lead quality. At that stage, $197 monthly is probably a no-brainer if it generates even one extra client.

If you're earlier in your journey—maybe you're making some money but inconsistently—YunaPro might accelerate your growth or it might be premature. Can you afford $197 per month while you're building? Do you have a proven offer that converts, or are you still figuring that part out?

If you're brand new and haven't made your first sale yet, probably hold off. Master the basics of creating valuable content and having sales conversations first. Automation multiplies what's already working; it doesn't fix fundamental business model problems.

The 30-day money-back guarantee gives you some runway to test it risk-free. Just install the software, follow the training, and see if your Facebook audience starts growing with better prospects. If not, they claim they'll refund you within one business day and let you keep the training materials.

**The Bottom Line**

YunaPro is a specialized tool built for one specific purpose: automating Facebook lead generation for online service businesses. It's not cheap, but it's comprehensive. The founders clearly know Facebook marketing inside and out, and they've packaged their system into software that handles the grunt work.

Does it live up to the hype? Based on available reviews and testimonials, many users find real value in the time savings and lead quality. The software does what it promises—find leads, engage with them, and track them through your sales process automatically.

Is it for everyone? Definitely not. But if you're serious about building or scaling an online business using Facebook, and you're tired of manually doing all the prospecting and follow-up, 👉 [YunaPro](https://yunapro.com?_go=li34) might be exactly what you need to finally get off the content hamster wheel and into actual client conversations.

The real test is simple: does the time you save and the extra clients you generate justify the monthly investment? For the right business at the right stage, the answer is probably yes.
